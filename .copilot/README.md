# .copilot Directory

This directory contains documentation and prompts specifically designed for interacting with GitHub Copilot and other AI development assistants.

## Purpose

The `.copilot` folder serves as a centralized location for:

- **Implementation plans** - Detailed technical specifications and architecture decisions
- **Development prompts** - Context-rich prompts for AI-assisted development
- **Project summaries** - High-level overviews of features and implementation strategies
- **AI interaction guides** - Documentation to help AI assistants understand the project structure and requirements

## Contents

- `PROMPT.md` - Main project context and development guidelines for AI assistants
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Overview of current implementation status and architecture
- `RECIPE_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md` - Detailed plan for Drupal Recipe integration feature

## Usage

These files are designed to be:

1. **Referenced by developers** when working with AI coding assistants
2. **Used as context** for GitHub Copilot Chat and similar tools
3. **Maintained and updated** as the project evolves
4. **Shared among team members** to ensure consistent AI-assisted development approaches

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation current with project changes
- Use clear, structured markdown for easy AI parsing
- Include specific technical details and code examples
- Reference actual file paths and function names from the codebase
- Update implementation plans as features are completed

This approach ensures that AI assistants have comprehensive context about the project, leading to more accurate and helpful suggestions during development.
