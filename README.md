# DDEV Drupal Ai

## Overview

**This the WIP repo that currently contains only the scaffold for the brand-new add-on**

This add-on integrates Drupal Ai into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) project, and it is designed 
to support contribution to the Drupal AI module ecosystem. It acts as a glue layer, streamlining 
the setup and orchestrating the AI capabilities in Drupal development environments.

With this add-on, you can:

* Run interactive workflows to install AI "recipes" (choose provider → functionality → setup).
* Easily request and install additional AI-related add-ons (e.g., `unstructured`, `pgvector`).
* Access a new official **pgvector** add-on for vector database capabilities in Drupal AI projects.

**Architecture**

* **Glue Add-on**: Works as a meta-tool inside DDEV.
* **Interactive CLI**: Provides guided installation and configuration of AI tools.
* **Recipe Management**: Handles dependencies and orchestrates pre-built AI workflows.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on get Drupal-AI/ddev-drupal-ai
ddev restart
```

After installation, make sure to commit the `.ddev` directory to version control.

## Usage

| Command | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `ddev describe` | View service status and used ports for Drupal Ai |
| `ddev logs -s drupal-ai` | Check Drupal Ai logs |

## Advanced Customization

To change the Docker image:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.drupal-ai --drupal-ai-docker-image="busybox:stable"
ddev add-on get Drupal-AI/ddev-drupal-ai
ddev restart
```

Make sure to commit the `.ddev/.env.drupal-ai` file to version control.

All customization options (use with caution):

| Variable | Flag | Default |
| -------- | ---- | ------- |
| `DRUPAL_AI_DOCKER_IMAGE` | `--drupal-ai-docker-image` | `busybox:stable` |
